        - Previously, this module used String::Random module which uses rand(),
          a built-in Perl function, to generate random tokens when the state
          and nonce parameters in OAuth2 are unset.
          However, the rand() function is vulnerable to a PRNG vulnerability
          called CWE-338, so it's not cryptographically secure.
          From this version, it has discarded dependencies of String::Random
          and has been replaced with Crypt::URandom::Token module,
          which uses the more secure /dev/urandom to generate tokens.
          - The above vulnerability was pointed out to me
            by Robert Rothenberg (RRWO). Thanks for pointing this out.
        - I'm aware that the above implementation has fixed the vulnerability
          in this module corresponding to the vulnerability number below.
